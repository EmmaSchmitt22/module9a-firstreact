# Module 9A - Build Your First React Component

## Description
This is a React app created using Vite that renders a UserProfile component. The component includes my name, bio, and monkey emojii styled with inline CSS.

## What I Learned
- How to set up a React project using Vite
- How to write and structure a functional React component
- How to use JSX and inline styles
- How to render a component in App.jsx

## Challenges
I had some trouble folowing ther step by step guide in the class module - the portion "follow the prompts" was nt appearing in my terminal, so I though I had missed a step. But, it turned out that the previous step had functionally accomplished the same task so that step was not necessary. I'm not entirely sure why.

Uploaded this into the class Canvas.
